# Project Best Practices Implementation Plan

This document provides a comprehensive, actionable checklist to ensure best practices are fully implemented in the RootzEngine project. Use this as a living reference and update as the project evolves.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Documentation

- [ ] Review and align with [`02-Directory_Structure_Guide.md`](02-Directory_Structure_Guide.md) for folder and file organization.

- [ ] Keep [`README.md`](../README.md) up to date with usage, features, and quick start instructions.

- [ ] Add/maintain docstrings and usage examples in all modules (see [`utils/`](../utils/) and [`pipeline.py`](../pipeline.py)).

- [ ] Update [`01-Project_Overview_and_Best_Practices.md`](01-Project_Overview_and_Best_Practices.md) with new workflows and standards.

## 2. Environment & Dependency Management

- [ ] Use [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) for all dependencies; update and pin versions regularly.

- [ ] Follow [`03-Environment_Management_Python_Tools.md`](03-Environment_Management_Python_Tools.md) for virtual environment setup (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).

- [ ] Automate dependency checks and updates (e.g., Dependabot, `pip-tools`).

## 3. Code Style & Linting

- [ ] Adopt conventions from [`04-Code_Style_And_Linting.md`](04-Code_Style_And_Linting.md):
  - Use `black` or `autopep8` for formatting.
  - Use `flake8` or `pylint` for linting.
  - Enforce type hints and docstrings.

- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.

## 4. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create unit tests for all major modules in [`utils/`](../utils/) and [`pipeline.py`](../pipeline.py).

- [ ] Add a `/tests` directory if not present.

- [ ] Automate tests with GitHub Actions or similar CI.

- [ ] Document test strategy in [`docs/`](.) (add a `TESTING.md` if needed).

## 5. Configuration & Secrets

- [ ] Centralize config in files like [`model-config.yaml`](../model-config.yaml).

- [ ] Never commit secrets; use environment variables or secret managers.

- [ ] Document config usage in [`docs/`](.) and in code comments.

## 6. Data Management

- [ ] Follow folder conventions for raw, enriched, and trash data ([`README.md`](../README.md), [`02-Directory_Structure_Guide.md`](02-Directory_Structure_Guide.md)).

- [ ] Automate data validation and logging (see [`output/`](../output/) and `/logs`).

- [ ] Document data flow in [`docs/`](.) and notebooks.

## 7. Notebooks & Reproducibility

- [ ] Keep notebooks clean: restart and clear outputs before committing.

- [ ] Move reusable code from notebooks to modules in [`utils/`](../utils/).

- [ ] Document notebook usage in [`docs/`](.) or in notebook markdown cells.

## 8. Collaboration & Contribution

- [ ] Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to outline PR, issue, and code review processes.

- [ ] Use issues and project boards for tracking work.

## 9. Troubleshooting & Support

- [ ] Maintain [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) with common errors and fixes.

- [ ] Encourage documentation of new issues as they arise.

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- [ ] Regularly review and update best practices in [`01-Project_Overview_and_Best_Practices.md`](01-Project_Overview_and_Best_Practices.md).

- [ ] Solicit feedback from contributors and users.
