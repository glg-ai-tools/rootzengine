# Data Management

- Raw data: `data/mp3_raw/`
- Enriched data: `data/mp3_enriched/`
- Trash/discarded data: `data/mp3_trash/`
- Output and logs: `output/`, `logs/`

Follow naming conventions and folder structure as described in `docs/02-Directory_Structure_Guide.md` and `README.md`.

Automate data validation and logging where possible.

Document data flow in `docs/` and notebooks.
