# README for tests

This directory contains all unit and integration tests for the RootzEngine project. Organize tests to mirror the structure of the main codebase (e.g., utils, pipeline, etc.).

- Place test files in the appropriate subdirectories.
- Use descriptive names (e.g., test_pipeline.py, test_config_loader.py).
- See docs/TESTING.md for test strategy and guidelines.
